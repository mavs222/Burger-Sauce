That’s it. Cool stuff. Which brings me to the code.

The Code
Before you run the code, check your PowerShell ExecutionPolicy settings. On Windows 10 computers the default setting is Restriced. In order to run the script, you have to change the policy to at least RemoteSigned.

Get-ExecutionPolicy
 
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force

Ready ? Now it’s party time.

Copy the code below into PowerShell ISE or an editor of your choosing. Run the code and enter username and password. Then restart the computer and check if it works as expected.
